      "My task is to design a textbook cover that illustrates the concept of finding the central value in mathematics. On the first cover, the idea is to find the median of the time students go to sleep. Each room will have a clock indicating the time at that moment and the room with no light indicated the bedtime of a particular student. On the second cover, the concept is about finding the median of prices, represented by fruit packaging with a price tag displayed on the box. From the arrangement of fruit boxes, you will see a shape of median graph.",
